# project-247
Hiper-Casual game made during my non-paid internship at a small indie game-dev group/company Deer Dev Studios (now known as Rock Game Studios).
It's a simple zombie shooting game, where the objective in each level is to shoot down all enemies using cannon and droppable power-ups.
I was a programmer and a game designer at once
